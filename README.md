This is Liberapay's salon, where the discussions that don't belong elsewhere take place.

The technical aspects of running the Liberapay service are discussed in the
[liberapay.com repository](https://github.com/liberapay/liberapay.com), the
legal ones in the [liberapay.org repository](https://github.com/liberapay/liberapay.org),
this salon is for everything else.
